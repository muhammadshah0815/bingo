# Online Bingo Game

Welcome to the Online Bingo Game! This game allows anywhere from 2 to an infinite number of players to participate in a single game session. Players aim to achieve lines on their bingo cards, with each line completion being marked by the letters B, I, N, G, O. Once a player completes all five lines, they achieve a "BINGO!"

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Node.js
- **Web Communication:** WebSockets

## Features
- **Dynamic Gameplay:** Players can join the game at any time, and the game can accommodate a variable number of players simultaneously.
- **Real-time Updates:** WebSockets are used for real-time communication between players and the server, ensuring that all participants see the current state of the game.
- **Interactive Bingo Cards:** Each player receives a unique bingo card generated by the server. The cards automatically update as numbers are called out during gameplay.
- **Progress Tracking:** As players achieve lines on their cards, the corresponding letters (B, I, N, G, O) are displayed. Once all five lines are completed, the "BINGO!" button becomes active.
- **User-friendly Interface:** The interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, suitable for players of all ages.
